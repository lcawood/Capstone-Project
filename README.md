The game consists of 4 rounds. Each player has a turn on a given round before the next round begins.
A player can win 1 point on each of rounds 1, 2, and 3, whereas round 4 can earn a player 2 points.
The overall winner has the most points after round 4. It is possible to tie.

Round 1: guess if the first card is a red card or a black card
Round 2: guess if the second card has a higher or lower value than the first card
(if the second card has the same value as the first then this is always a win)
Round 3: guess if the third card value lies inside or outside the first two cards
